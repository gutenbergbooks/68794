<h2 class="nobreak">THE<br />
MAYFLOWER SOCIETY HOUSE</h2>


<p class="drop-capy">A NOTABLE accomplishment of the General Society of
Mayflower Descendants was the purchase in 1941 of the
Edward Winslow House in Plymouth, Massachusetts, a
house of great beauty and dignity, with history and atmosphere,
perfectly located on North Street, one of the five streets laid out
by the Pilgrims, overlooking Plymouth Rock and Cole’s Hill, where
lie the bones of many of the Pilgrims.</p>

<p>North Street was laid out before 1633. It was first named New
Street, later Queen Street, and for some years was called Howland
Street, presumably because Joseph Howland, son of John Howland,
the Pilgrim, owned land on the north side. His son Thomas inherited
it, and in turn it descended to the latter’s son, Consider Howland,
who sold it to Edward Winslow, the great-grandson of Edward
Winslow, third Governor of the Colony. The younger Winslow
attended Harvard College and then settled in Plymouth. He became
Clerk of the Court, Registrar of Probate, and Collector of the
Port. He married in 1741, the widow, Hannah Howland Dyer, a
sister of Consider Howland, and in 1754 built the house.</p>

<p>Winslow was a Royalist and an outspoken supporter of the King.
Although a popular man, the townspeople became infuriated at his
lack of patriotism, which eventually cost him his town offices and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
revenue. His son joined the King’s forces, and he frequently entertained
the British officers at his home. After the evacuation of
Boston by the British, Winslow moved his family to New York, and
was granted a pension by Sir Henry Clinton.</p>

<p>Later the family went to Halifax, as did thousands of other Tories,
where Winslow died the following year, at the age of seventy-two.
He was buried in St. Paul’s Churchyard, mourned by all the dignitaries
of the city. At this time Canada was actively hostile to
the United States.</p>

<p>In order to support his family after losing his offices, Winslow
had pledged his house as security for loans of money made him by
Thomas Davis, William Thomas, Oakes Angier, and John Rowe.
When he left Plymouth the house was sold on an “execution” at a
sacrifice to satisfy the creditors, much to Winslow’s indignation.
It is often mistakenly stated that his property was confiscated.
The house at this time was half its present size and, as was customary
in those days, sat close to the ground, as well as to the street.
The frame of the house and some of the paneling are said to have
been brought from England, although American craftsmen could
and did construct similar houses and paneling.</p>

<p>From Winslow’s creditors the house passed into the hands of
Thomas Jackson who occupied it as a residence until 1813, when
he moved to the so-called Cotton Farm. The house then passed
by an execution from Mr. Jackson to his cousin Charles Jackson,
who died in it in 1818 and whose son, Charles Thomas Jackson,
born 21 June 1805, played an interesting part in the civil history
of this country. He had a keen mind, was a student of electricity
and magnetism, but medicine was his main study. He graduated
from Harvard Medical School in 1827, finishing his studies abroad.
He returned to America on the sailing vessel with Samuel F. B.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Morse, and their meeting may have helped Morse perfect his telegraphic
instrument. It is known that Jackson made and displayed
a model of a telegraphic instrument a year before Morse patented
the one that made him famous.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i007" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i007.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">CHARLES THOMAS JACKSON &#160; &#160; &#160; WILLIAM T. G. MORTON &#160; &#160; &#160;</div>
</div>

<p>Jackson was greatly interested in geology and was the State
Geologist of Maine in 1836, Rhode Island in 1839, and New Hampshire
in 1840, but his greatest claim to fame is his share in discovering
etherization and his association with Dr. W. T. G. Morton, a
dental surgeon, fourteen years his junior, who studied medicine in
his office. Jackson is believed to have made his first personal experiments
with the inhalation of ether in the house at Plymouth,
and the chair in which he sat is displayed in Pilgrim Hall. Morton
patented the process of anesthesia by ether in 1846 and he sued
Jackson for claiming the discovery of the anesthetic effects of inhalation
of ether back in the winter of 1841-42. The French Government
investigated the matter and decreed Jackson a 2500 franc
prize as the discoverer, and a similar prize to Morton for being the
first to apply it to surgical operations.</p>

</div>

<p>Jackson’s slightly older sister Lydia, sometimes called Lidian,
became the second wife of Ralph Waldo Emerson, the American
poet and philosopher. Their marriage took place in 1835 in the
east parlor, later known as the music room.</p>

</div>

<p>The house was sold by the Charles Jackson heirs in 1872 to Lucia J.
Briggs, the wife of the Rev. George W. Briggs, who occupied it as a
summer residence until 1898, when it was purchased by Charles L.
Willoughby, of Chicago, for a summer home. Gardens were planned
and planted. Joseph Everett Chandler, authority on the restoration
of New England houses and author of books on the subject,
was retained to supervise the work, and it is he we have to thank
that so much was saved when it was converted into a gentleman’s
estate. He it was who saw to it that the new windows, inner shutters,
paneling, and many details, are in keeping with the original structure.
He even saw to it that the Tory chimney, with its coping
painted black, was saved and that the two lovely linden trees, said
to have been planted by Edward Winslow’s daughter Penelope, were
protected during the alteration. In tearing off the ell on the north
side, a board was uncovered on which was painted “Built by William
Drew 1820,” which indicates additions were made that year. The
house was moved back thirty feet, raised five, porches were built,
side doors, new rooms, and a cupola or, as some erroneously call it,
a Widow’s Walk, were added.</p>

<p>To own an old house is a great privilege, but it is also a great
responsibility. No amount of money could have made the Winslow
house so interesting as its association with events of history and
famous people has made it.</p>

<p>Improvements were continued after Mr. Willoughby’s death.
Adjoining houses were purchased and razed, improving the view of
the Rock and the ocean, and the land they were on was added to
the already extensive garden.</p>

<p>A five-car garage was built to the far side of the garden, arranged
so that it would be possible to use it as a charity theatre, with quarters
overhead for the gardener and his family. As protection against
the elements and the public, a six foot red brick wall of Colonial
design was erected on the south and east sides of the estate.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>REAR GARDEN TEA HOUSE AND CONSERVATORY FROM THE SOLARIUM</p></div>
</div>

<p>After Mrs. Willoughby’s death, her daughter offered the property
for sale. It is fortunate that it passed into the hands of the General
Society of Mayflower Descendants (31 December 1941). It might
have become a Tea Room, a Road House, or something worse.
The Society immediately took up the work of restoration and preservation
where Mr. Chandler had left off, but before work could even be
started, World War II broke out and the entire Winslow House was
turned over to the Plymouth Chapter of the American Red Cross for
the duration without charge of any kind. Due to confusion, especially
of legal nature, likely to arise, and which in fact had arisen, by the
existence of a Winslow House in nearby Marshfield, it was decided
at the Seventeenth Congress of the General Society held in Plymouth
September 1946, and so voted, to change the name of the Edward
Winslow House to the Mayflower Society House.</p>

<p>The house today is far different from the one Edward Winslow
built in 1754, but, as the headquarters of a large society, it is better
adapted. The interior is being brought back to something of its
original appearance with paint and replicas of old wall paper and
by gifts and purchases of furniture of the 18th Century period.
Members of the Mayflower Society and any interested in preserving
the best of the 18th century are asked to contribute items of furniture,
wearing apparel, books or other items of the period. All gifts
and loans, before being accepted, are passed on by a competent
committee. To have an item accepted and exhibited in the Mayflower
Society House will some day be a distinction.</p>

<p>The Mayflower Society House is not only a show place of Plymouth,
but of the entire country. This lovely and famous house is
owned, free and clear of indebtedness, by the General Society of
Mayflower Descendants. To insure its perpetual care through
generations to come, an endowment is sought to which the public
is asked to and should contribute.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_GENERAL_SOCIETY_OF">THE GENERAL SOCIETY OF
MAYFLOWER DESCENDANTS</h2>

<p class="drop-capy">NOT until 1894 did descendants of the passengers of the
<i>Mayflower</i> organize to perpetuate the ideals and commemorate
the memory of their ancestors. The first Society
was formed 22 December 1894 in New York, followed by
societies in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania within
18 months. These societies founded the General Society 12 January
1897. The General Society now consists of 40 State Societies, with
a membership of over 7600 men and women.</p>

<p>19 February 1923 the General Society was incorporated under
the laws of Massachusetts. Among those signing the petition to the
Great and General Court were Major General Leonard Wood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
William Howard Taft, and Henry Cabot Lodge. The Mayflower
Society is not interested in the wealth of its members, or their social
standing, or their politics, although two Presidents of the United
States have been members. Two others were eligible but passed on
before its organization. It is proud, however, of the notable achievements
of many of its members.</p>

<p>Some of the patriotic Societies were in early days largely social in
character. Many joined solely of pride in their ancestry. Democracy
was not then under attack and needed no defenders. The country’s
growth since the turn of the century has brought to the United
States a tremendous number of persons fleeing from Old World
conditions. Our melting pot did well for a time; of recent years our
freedom has been attacked. The Society now has a mission—that
of spreading the wisdom and ideals of our ancestors to the masses
who have come to our shores.</p>

<p>The Society has accomplished much in its effort to discover and
publish matter relating to the Pilgrims. It has aided in establishing
memorials and has contributed over $100,000.00 toward the Bradford
Memorial Tablet, the Provincetown Monument, the Monument
to the Pilgrims at Southampton, England, the Sarcophagus on
Cole’s Hill, Plymouth, the Aptuxet Trading Post, at Bourne, the
Mayflower Index, and to lesser memorials throughout the country.
One of the most important things accomplished is the purchase and
restoration of the Mayflower Society House. This is more than a
National Headquarters. It is propaganda for Americanism. It is
a landmark that will inspire those who visit Plymouth to increase
their knowledge of the Pilgrims and thus help make better citizens
of them, and it is a contribution to patriotism. Plymouth welcomes
another museum house, particularly an 18th century one, where
visitors may learn more of Colonial life and customs. The important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
thing is that visitors to the Mayflower Society House, who number
thousands each year, coming from every state in the Union, find
there exists an organization to perpetuate the memory and carry
forward the ideals of the Pilgrims.</p>

<p>When the General Society of Mayflower Descendants was organized,
it adopted a declaration of purpose, the most important part
of which is to commemorate and honor the Pilgrims, to defend
the principle of civil and religious liberty, as set forth in the <a href="#Page_28">Mayflower
Compact</a>, to discover and publish original matter pertaining
to the Pilgrims, and to authenticate, preserve, and mark spots of
Pilgrim association.</p>

<p>These things the historian, orator, and poet have helped do. In
our libraries are carefully prepared writings on the subject by Fiske,
Dexter, John Quincy Adams and Daniel Webster, Choate, Everett
and Sumner, and so on down to Henry Cabot Lodge, Calvin Coolidge,
and the third Governor Bradford. So diligent have writers and
speakers been, it is difficult to find and add new facts.</p>

<p>There are those who say, “It’s not what my ancestors did, it’s
what I’ve done. I live in the present, not the past.” One must
make good, but statistics prove those most successful are the first
to preserve the best of the past.</p>

<p>It is fitting and proper that the descendants of the Pilgrims should
gather in Plymouth from time to time and give expression to the
respect, gratitude and admiration they feel for the Pilgrims. To
express sympathy for them for the terrible months they spent crossing
the stormy Atlantic, and the added months on shipboard while
shelters were being erected on shore for the first winter in a foreign
land, when nearly half the company died of scurvy and ship fever,
in spite of which not one member gave up and returned to England
when the <i>Mayflower</i> sailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>The Pilgrims believed in the equality of all men before God; they,
therefore, made all men equal before the Law. On the Sarcophagus,
which contains the remains of some of the Pilgrims, is this inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This monument marks the first burying-ground in Plymouth of the Passengers
of the Mayflower. Here, under cover of darkness, the fast dwindling
Company laid their dead; levelling the earth above them lest the
Indians should learn how many were the graves. <em>READER</em>, History
records no nobler venture for Faith and Freedom than that of this Pilgrim
band. In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and
cold they laid the foundations of a State wherein every man, through
countless ages, should have liberty to worship God in his own way. May
their example inspire thee to do thy part in perpetuating and spreading
throughout the World the lofty Ideals of our Republic.”</p>
</div>

<p>We must admire the Pilgrims for their courage and piety, for their
attachment to civil rights and religious liberty in exile, under unhappy
conditions.</p>

<p>There was a famine the first year, but no actual starvation as there
were wild fowl, shellfish, and berries in abundance, but there was
cold and snow, and there were Indians and sickness to cope with.</p>

<p>A great disaster befell the community the second year which
seldom seems to be mentioned, but which would have discouraged
less resolute souls. The ship <i>Fortune</i> carrying their entire year’s
yield of furs and products to England to be sold, was captured by
the French as a prize.</p>

<p>The gist of the preface of a book entitled “The Pilgrim Fathers,”
by W. H. Bartlett, published in London, England, in 1853, is—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of the many heroic emigrations from our island, which have covered the
face of the earth, no one is more singular than the band of sectaries driven
forth in the reign of James I. In an age when toleration was unknown,
they were thrust forth from their native land, thus the harshness of the
rulers became the instrument which planted on American shores a mighty
republic, the proudest and most powerful offshoot of the mother country,
whose institutions, as thus founded, are not without a powerful reaction
upon her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>“The details of the story are unknown to the mass of English readers,
while across the Atlantic they are known to almost every child, and numerous
are the works published about them and many are the Americans who
visit Boston, Scrooby and Leyden, but these publications and researchers
are all unknown in England and therefore this continuous narrative.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PILGRIMS">THE PILGRIMS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-capy">WHO and what were the Pilgrims and in what way did they
differ from the Puritans? They both were English and
both lived in the same generation. The Pilgrims were a
small band of staunch men, women and children who came to America
for religious freedom. They were a part of a great movement. The
Protestant Reformation, set on foot in England during the reign of
Henry VIII, was finally accomplished in 1588 by the defeat of the
Spanish Armada. It did not secure freedom of action or worship,
however. There was no country then where such liberty was allowed;
in fact, such a thing had never been thought of. The Reformation
made the Sovereign, instead of the Pope, the head of the church
in England, and there were changes in doctrine and ceremonials, but
everyone was required to attend church whether he wished to or not
and was also taxed to support it. The Bible had just been translated
from Latin into English, and for the first time it was being
generally circulated (1557-60).</p>

<p>Among the Protestant reformers there were many who were not
satisfied with the doctrines and ritual of the English church. They
wished to simplify the government of the church and drop some of
the ceremonies. This they considered purifying the church, which
gave them the name of Puritans. Most of them had no thought or
intention of leaving the Established Church. They wished to stay
and be a part of it, but to change it according to their ideas.</p>

  <div class="caption">EDWARD WINSLOW, third Governor of Plymouth Colony. Great-grandfather of Edward Winslow,

Pilgrim of whom there exists an authentic picture</div>
</div>

<p>Early in 1567 a number of ministers, despairing of getting the
desired changes, made up their minds to separate from the church
and hold religious services of their own. Robert Brown was one of
them and went about the country advocating this policy of separation.
Those who adopted it became known as Separatists or
Brownists. They did not believe in having bishops rule over them.
Some denied that the queen was head of the church. This was called
treason. These were the people who became Pilgrims. The Puritans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
also questioned the spiritual authority of the bishops and claimed
the right to worship as they saw fit, but they did nothing in particular
about it.</p>

<p>The Separatists, or better, Independents, which describes them
accurately, established a little church in the hamlet of Scrooby,
near Lincoln, where a congregation listened to the eloquent preaching
of John Robinson. English laws provided imprisonment for
those who refused to attend the Established Church, or were present
at unlawful assemblies, with the further penalties, that the convicted
must conform within three months or leave the country. If
he refused, he should be deemed a felon and put to death without
the benefit of clergy. The little church at Scrooby could not continue
under these conditions. Some of the Separatists had given
their lives, some were in prison, and others were in exile. Brown
had fled the country, and so its members determined to cross to
Holland. Under existing laws a family could not migrate without
a license, and they were denied one. It was as dangerous to remain
as it was to attempt to leave secretly. Meetings were held, and
Separatists from Scrooby, Bristol, Exeter, Boston, and sundry other
places planned to flee.</p>

<p>In October 1607 they made their first attempt to leave from
Boston in a chartered ship. They were seized, searched, and imprisoned.
After a month all but seven of the principal men were
released.</p>

<p>The next year they arranged with a Dutch ship to meet them at
a port near Grimsby at the mouth of the Humber, but the cautious
skipper got scared and after taking a few of the women and children
aboard, cast off, leaving the husbands and a majority to be seized
by the sheriff and his men. Following this, there was no mass effort
to cross to Holland, but, with much difficulty and by departing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
one or two at a time, all got over. After a short stay in Amsterdam
they made their way to Leyden. Here they were joined by other
refugees from England, until there were more than a thousand.
The Pilgrims remained in Leyden for eleven years (1609 to 1620).
Brewster became a printer, Robinson entered the University, and
all found work in different occupations. They labored hard and
continuously. They found in Holland peace and the religious
freedom they had left their English homes for, but there were other
factors which made them, after a decade, seriously consider leaving
Holland. They wished the protection of the English flag; they
were losing the English language, and their children were marrying
among the Dutch. After careful consideration they decided that
the Virginia Colony, extending from Florida to New York, offered
the best opportunity. Because of their separation from the Established
Church, the King would not guarantee them protection,
but agreed not to molest them, and under this agreement they
obtained a patent from the London Company to settle on the New
Jersey Coast.</p>

<p>It was necessary to secure financial aid, and this they obtained
from a group of London merchants, known as the Adventurers.
The contract was an oppressive one and became more so as the
colonists built their houses; but it cannot be called unfair, considering
the financial risk involved. It provided that for seven
years the income of the colony should go into a common fund and
from this the colonists would get their living. At the end of the period
the investment and profits, real and personal, should be equally
divided between the Adventurers and the Planters in accordance
with the number of shares each held. Its effect was to establish a
community life which, long before the seven years were up, resulted
in embarrassment and open disaffection, and a compromise between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the parties was effected by which the Adventurers were to be paid
the sum of eighteen hundred pounds sterling 26 November 1626.
Here was Communism pure and simple, and it was a monumental
failure and was given up after three years. If Communism cannot
succeed under these conditions, with the type of people the Pilgrims
were, speaking the same language, governed by the same laws, with
common history, tradition, and memories, how could Communism
possibly prove a success under far less favorable circumstances
today?</p>

<p>The conditions upon which the Pilgrims secured their transportation
to America indicate the exhausted state of their finances, and
they probably never would have given their assent to the conditions
imposed, if not absolutely forced to do so. The famous Captain John
Smith wrote in 1624 that the Adventurers who raised the money
to begin and supply the Plymouth plantation were about seventy
in number, some merchants, some handicraftsmen, some risking
great sums, some small, as their affection served. They dwelt mostly
about London, knit together by a voluntary combination in a society,
without constraint or penalty, aiming to do good and plant religion.
The sad intelligence conveyed by the <i>Mayflower</i> on her return to
London of the sufferings, sickness, and death, produced a disheartening
effect in the most zealous friends, and the necessary supplies
required by the infant colony were refused, though they had been
promised.</p>

<p>After the Pilgrims had secured financial aid the little band (July
1620) left Leyden and sailed from Delfts-haven in Holland in the
<i>Speedwell</i>, which they had bought for the purpose, to Southampton
where the <i>Mayflower</i> was awaiting them with friends. Two weeks
later the <i>Mayflower</i> and the <i>Speedwell</i> left Southampton for America.
The <i>Mayflower</i> of one hundred and eighty tons burden (the <i>Queen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Mary</i> of today is over eighty-three thousand tons) had been chartered
to transport a part of the Leyden congregation to America.</p>

<p>Before they were out of the English Channel the <i>Speedwell</i> began
leaking badly and they ran into Dartmouth for repairs. 2 September
they made a second start, but trouble developed and they returned
this time to Plymouth. Here they reorganized the expedition.
The <i>Speedwell</i> was left behind, some of her passengers were taken on
the <i>Mayflower</i> and the others left in England. On 16 September
1620 the <i>Mayflower</i> sailed again and ten weeks later, after a voyage
filled with hardships and peril, having been driven far off her course,
came to anchor in Cape Cod Harbor. When the Cape was sighted
it was decided to sail south for a permanent home, but before the
day was over they found themselves in dangerous shoals and roaring
breakers and turned back to settle beyond the limits of their patent.</p>

<p>Only about one half of the passengers on the <i>Mayflower</i> were
members of the Leyden congregation. Other motives, without
thought of religious dissent or separation from the Established Church
of England, had added many strangers to the company, and there
arose mutterings of discontent among them.</p>

<p>It became evident, therefore, that some means should be devised
to maintain law and order as they were out of the jurisdiction of
their patent. To accomplish this the members of the Pilgrim Company
met in the cabin of the <i>Mayflower</i> off the shores of Cape Cod
on 21 November 1620 and banded themselves together by the now
famous document known as the Mayflower Compact.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Page_28">Mayflower Compact</a> is a great contribution to civil liberty
and democracy; it ranks with the Declaration of Independence and
the Constitution of the United States. Our democracy was based
on it from the landing of the Pilgrims. The Pilgrims established
what they planned. The Plymouth settlement was the start of religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
freedom. We owe them a great debt of gratitude. They were
unimportant people, and their departure attracted little or no attention.
Some were educated, others were not; some had means,
most little or nothing, but all had character and courage. We call
them ordinary people, but their accomplishment made history.
When they wrote and signed the Compact they gave the world a
new political idea for government by the people, and when, under
the Compact, they organized the government of Plymouth, they
laid the foundation of political liberty for this nation.</p>

<p>Students of governmental history the world over, as well as statesmen,
now know of the Mayflower Compact and discuss it. It cannot
receive too much publicity, and there is no better place to reprint
it than here in this story of the “House of Edward Winslow” where
it can be easily and frequently perused.</p>

<p>In no part of the world up to then did there exist a government
of just and equal laws. It is the first incident where a government
was formed by the governed, by their consent in writing at one
time. One hundred and fifty years later its principles really framed
the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United
States, and our laws today are interwoven with the ideals of this
band of Pilgrims.</p>

<p>One month after the signing of the Compact, the exploring party
of eighteen men in the ship’s shallop that had left the ship 16 December,
landed at Plymouth. Plymouth was not just what they wanted,
but as Brewster said, it was the best they had seen. They returned
to the ship and on 26 December 1620 the <i>Mayflower</i> and her passengers
reached Plymouth. It was 31 March that the last of them
went ashore for good.</p>

<p>On 15 April 1621 the <i>Mayflower</i> sailed on her return trip, leaving
every one of the survivors of the Pilgrim Company behind. It was a
more striking picture than her departure from England. A situation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
more discouraging for the Pilgrims could hardly be conceived.</p>

<p>Some interesting occurrences which happened on board the <i>Mayflower</i>
during the trip, are taken from the manuscript of “Prince’s
Annals,” in his handwriting. Prince had drawn his pen diagonally
across the passages, and they do not appear in his published work.
They were first printed in the April number 1847 the <cite>New England
Historical and Genealogical Register</cite>. It reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In a mighty storme a lustie yonge man called John Howland came upon
some occasion above ye gratings, was with a seele of ye ship throwne into
ye sea; but it pleased God yt he caught hould of ye top saile halliards,
which hung overboard and rane out at length; yet he held his hould (though
he was sundrie fadomes under water) till he was hald up by ye same rope
to ye brink of ye water and then with a boat hook and other means got
into ye shipe again, and his life saved, and though he was somewhat ill
with it, yet he lived many years after, and became a profitable member
both of church and comonwelth.”</p>
</div>

<p>And the manuscript goes on to tell of a proud, very profane young
man, one of the seamen of husky and able body, which made him the
more haughty, who was always annoying the poor people in their
sickness by cursing them daily and telling them he hoped to help
cast half of them overboard before they came to their journey’s end
and if he ever, by any was gently reproved, he would curse and
swear most bitterly. But it pleased God to smite this young man
with a grievous disease, of which he died in a desperate manner and
so was himself the first to be thrown overboard.</p>

<p>John Carver, who had been chosen Governor, died the first winter,
and William Bradford succeeded him. The Colony grew slowly.
By 1630 it had but 300 persons in it, but it had paid the London
merchants. There is little question that the contract was burdensome
and oppressive. But as proof that the Pilgrims harbored no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
resentment is this laudable act: the Plymouth Colony General Court
in 1660 ordered that twenty pounds should be sent to a Mr. Ling, one
of the Merchant Adventurers, “who had fallen to decay and had felt
great extremity of poverty, the same twenty pounds being bestowed
on him towards his relief and if it was not given voluntarily that
the amount that fell short ‘bee’ made up out of the ‘Countrey
stocke’ by the Treasurer.”</p>

<p>The Colony made a treaty with Massasoit, Chief of the Wampanoag
Indians, which lasted until broken by his son in 1675. By
1640 the population had increased to over 3000.</p>

<p>As for the Puritans, they became powerful in England and comprised
many men of wealth and culture and social standing. Little
bodies of them, encouraged by the example of the Pilgrims, began
to settle upon the shores of Massachusetts. In 1628 John Endicott
and a shipload took command of the place the Indians called Naumkeag
and gave it the Bible name of Salem, or Peace. When they arrived
they found Roger Conant and his followers, who were, after
several years of struggling, happily settled. Endicott practically
kicked them out. Within a few years all of Conant’s followers had
moved across the river and established new homes in what became
Beverly.</p>

<p>In 1629 a number of leading Puritans in England bought of the
Plymouth Company a large tract of land, bounded by the Charles
and Merrimac Rivers and stretching inland indefinitely. They got a
charter from Charles I and incorporated as the Governor and Company
of Massachusetts Bay. Under John Winthrop, a wise and
able man, they came over to Salem, bringing 1000 persons, with
horses and cattle, and during that year Charlestown, Chelsea, and a
small hilly peninsular, called by the Indians Shawmut and by the
English Trimountain, or Tremont, and soon changed to Boston, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
which the leading settlers had come, were settled. By 1634 nearly
4000 settlers had arrived from England, coming usually in congregations,
led by their minister and settled together in parishes or
townships until there were about twenty.</p>

<p>In 1636 it was voted to establish a college three miles from Boston
at a place called New Town, now Cambridge. A young clergyman,
John Harvard, bequeathed his books and half his estate and the
new college was called by his name.</p>

<p>The colonization of New England was a complicated affair. The
Massachusetts Bay Colony was the largest. South of it was the
Plymouth Colony, the oldest. Then there was Rhode Island and
Providence Plantation and the Connecticut Colony. In 1643 these
four Colonies formed a confederation for defense called the United
Colonies of New England. In 1692 King William arranged things
to his liking; he annexed the Plymouth Colony to the Massachusetts
Bay Colony, but let Connecticut and Rhode Island keep their
beloved charters, and so the Plymouth Colony forever after remained
a part of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The establishment of the New England Confederacy, the division
of the ancient church, the annexation to the Massachusetts
Bay Colony, the loss of wealth and population, marked the end of
Plymouth as an independent Colony, but not of the great influence
which the Plymouth Colony and the Pilgrims have exerted, and, we
hope, will continue to exert with increasing force, in perpetuating,
as it originally established, our democratic form of government.</p>
